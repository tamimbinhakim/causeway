# IR Stability

Causeway keeps two inspectable shapes: the **IR** and the **App Graph**.

The IR is the wire contract between Causeway and generated clients:
routes, params, bodies, responses, declared errors, streams, and exposed
settings. The App Graph is the framework metadata shape: source files,
route keys, scopes, middleware, providers, refreshes, permissions,
idempotency, plugins, tasks, and events.

This page is about the IR contract: what is frozen, what can evolve, and what counts as breaking. See [App Graph](../client/app-graph.md) for the metadata shape that sits beside it.

## What lives in the IR

For each Causeway app:

- **Routes** — route key + path + method + handler input/output schemas +
  declared raises + stream marker.
- **Background tasks** — task id (module path + function name), queue,
  retry / backoff policy, payload schema.

If `causeway.toml` exposes config keys (`[client] expose_settings = [...]`),
those keys also land in the IR — secrets are explicitly excluded.

## Stability invariants (post-1.0)

Additive-only:

- New IR fields are always optional. Consumers that don't know about a
  field ignore it; consumers that do know never see a missing required
  value.
- New task registrations are non-breaking — they add capabilities to the
  client surface.

Breaking (require a major bump and a deprecation cycle):

- Removing or renaming an IR field.
- Changing a field's type in a non-widening way.
- Changing the URL pattern of a registered route (e.g. flipping
  `(group)/` semantics).
- Changing the public route key for an existing route.
- Changing the queue or retry policy default for `@task`.

## Deprecation cycle

A breaking change goes through:

1. **Minor release N**: the new behavior is added behind a flag; the old
   behavior is the default and emits a `DeprecationWarning`. Changelog
   calls it out.
2. **Minor release N+1**: the new behavior is the default; the old
   behavior is still available via the flag and still emits a
   `DeprecationWarning`.
3. **Major release**: the old behavior is removed.

That's one full minor of warnings before removal. Long enough for
downstream users to migrate; short enough to keep moving.

## What `causeway diff` checks

`causeway diff <baseline> <candidate>` flags:

- Removed routes.
- Renamed route handlers (same path + method, different function
  identity → likely a refactor, not breaking).
- Changed request / response schemas (narrowed types, removed fields).
- Removed `@raises` types from the union (clients had to handle them,
  can't anymore).
- Removed tasks.
- Changed task queue / retry policy defaults.

CI runs `causeway diff` against `main` on every PR. Breaking changes
annotate the PR with GitHub error annotations and require a `feat!:` or
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to land.

## What's _not_ in the IR

- Source file paths (handlers move; the IR shouldn't break when they do).
- Middleware/provider implementation details.
- Private modules / helpers.
- Plugin adapter internals (only the contract type is registered, not
  the implementation).
- Dev-only middleware (request id, error overlay) — those are framework
  concerns, not part of the app's contract.

## Versioning the IR itself

The IR schema versions independently from Causeway. A Causeway `1.x` always
emits an IR that conforms to its declared IR-schema version. IR schema
changes themselves follow the same deprecation cycle.

## Consumers

The IR is consumed by:

- **The typed-client codegen** — generates the TypeScript client off the
  IR snapshot.
- **`causeway diff`** — the CI breaking-change checker.
- **`causeway-deploy-*`** — deploy adapters that need to know "which routes
  are streaming", "which tasks are long-running" to set timeouts
  correctly.
- **Third-party tools** — anything that wants to introspect a Causeway app
  (admin generators, monitoring sidecars, …).

If you're writing a consumer, the IR schema is your contract. The
Python `causeway.ir` module is **not** the contract — that's an
implementation detail and may change.
