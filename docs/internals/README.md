# Internals

A contributor's tour. These docs are aimed at people who are reading or modifying Causeway itself — fixing a routing bug, writing a new plugin contract, cutting a release.

If you're trying to **use** Causeway to build an app, you're in the wrong directory. Start at [the docs root](../README.md).

## In this directory

- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** — the 30-second mental model and the layer-by-layer tour. What happens when you type `causeway dev`.
- **[Code map](./code-map.md)** — every file in `packages/causeway/src/causeway/` annotated. The thing you read once and bookmark.
- **[Contributing (deep)](./contributing.md)** — beyond the top-level [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md): coding conventions, when to add a comment vs. delete one, how to handle plugin packages, why a public symbol gets re-exported.
- **[Testing strategy](./testing.md)** — what we test, what we don't, where the bar is.
- **[Releases](./releases.md)** — how release-please drives PyPI publishes, what changes versioning, how to ship a hotfix.
- **[Writing a new official plugin](./plugin-authoring.md)** — the on-ramp for a maintainer adding a sibling `causeway-<role>-<impl>` package.
- **[Runtime substrate](../architecture/runtime-substrate.md)** — `causeway._runtime`: the typed-RPC engine under the convention layer. Read this before touching `_runtime/*` or before building a different framework on the same primitives.

## The rule that decides most arguments

> If there are two reasonable ways to do something, one of them is wrong and we kill it.

That's it. That's the rule. It's why the docs are short and the code is short.
