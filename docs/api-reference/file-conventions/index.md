# File conventions

Every filename pattern Causeway recognizes inside `src/app/routes/`.

## Quick reference

| Pattern                                | Style    | URL effect                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [`index.py`](./index-py.md)            | folder   | the folder's URL itself                    |
| `foo.py`                               | both     | `/foo`                                     |
| [`[name].py`](./bracket-name.md)       | folder   | dynamic segment → `/{name}`                |
| `[name]/...`                           | folder   | dynamic folder                             |
| [`$name`](./dollar-name.md)            | dot-flat | dynamic segment → `/{name}`                |
| `.index`                               | dot-flat | trailing `index` is dropped (match parent) |
| [`(group)/`](./group.md)               | both     | stripped from URL                          |
| [`_middleware.py`](./middleware-py.md) | folder   | per-subtree middleware                     |
| [`_scope.py`](./scope-py.md)           | folder   | per-subtree DI providers + lifespan        |
| `_*.py`, `_*/`                         | folder   | private — colocated helpers, not routed    |
| `[...rest].py`                         | folder   | catch-all — **reserved** for v0.2+         |
| `$$rest.py`                            | dot-flat | catch-all — **reserved** for v0.2+         |

## Style mixing

Folder hierarchy and dotted leaf concatenate freely. `api/v1.$version.posts.py` → `/api/v1/{version}/posts`. `_middleware.py` and `_scope.py` are always folder-scoped.

## Translation rules

Implemented in `causeway._paths.url_for`. The full grammar:

1. Walk the path parts from root to leaf.
2. For each folder part:
   - `(group)` → stripped.
   - `[name]` → `{name}`.
   - `[...rest]` → `NotImplementedError` (reserved).
   - `_*` → never reaches here; private folders are skipped.
   - anything else → literal segment.
3. For the leaf filename (without `.py`), split on `.`:
   - trailing `index` → dropped.
   - `(group)` → stripped.
   - `$name` → `{name}`.
   - `$$rest` → `NotImplementedError` (reserved).
   - `[name]` → `{name}` (folder-style brackets work in leaves too).
   - anything else → literal segment.
4. Join with `/`, prefix with `/`. Empty result → `/`.
